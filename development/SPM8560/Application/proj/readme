SPM8560 boot proj makefiles have been modified for a pboot bug.  
There was an upgrade problem on, in or about upgrading to 4.3.  The bug was 
such that the upgrade buffer in ram was corrupted and would never be
able to load the new application.  As such, the changes added to 
workaround this bug involve a slightly adjusted boot procedure
(with differently named files).  This readme documents those adjustments:

pre 4.3             post 4.3
SPM8560bboot        SPM8560Bbboot
SPM8560pboot        SPM8560Bpboot
		    SPM8560app
		    SPM8560pboot
SPM8560app          SPM8560Bapp

Okay, so we had to change the cardtype from SPM8560 to SPM8560B.  When pboot runs,
it will try to load the SPM8560app.  The SPM8560 app is really a customized PBOOT
that is small enough to not be corrupted by the upgrade buffer problem.  It then
has the specialized job of loading the real application without corrupting the upgrade
buffer.  SPM8560pboot is just a copy of the regular pboot (SPM8560Bpboot) and 
just provided on the disk for backwards compatibility and downgrade scenario's.

The SPM8560app load (which is just a customized version of PBOOT) uses its own 
unique copies of pboot.c and customdialog.  So for SPM8560app, we use the files
pbootB.c and customdialog_ppc_8560B.c.  For the other, regular pboot loaders, we use
pboot.c and customdialog_ppc_8560.c.
